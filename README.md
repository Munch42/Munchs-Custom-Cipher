# Munchs Custom Cipher
 This is my custom cipher that I am making for the #42SkillsChallenge and just  because I find it intersting.

# Usage
 To use the program, download all of the files and simply run the customCipher.py file. Make sure to keep notepad or some other program open so that you can store your key and encrypted text as you don't want to lose those. If you lose your key, it is very unlikely that you will be able to recover your text so make sure to store it securely in a place where you won't lose even 1 character of the key. EVERY CHARACTER OF THE KEY COUNTS, if you remove even a single character it will spew out almost complete nonsense when it trys to decode your message so be extremely careful with your keys if you don't want to lose your data. On the other side of this however, if someone else doesn't have every single character of your key, it will be extremely hard for them to crack at least as far as I know.
 
## Once you open the program:
 Once you open the program, follow its prompts to create or input a key and then to decide whether or not you want to encrypt something or decrypt something with the key you put in.
